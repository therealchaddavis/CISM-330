<p>I'm an experienced Desktop Support Technician who has worked for large fortune 100 companies as well as startups.<br>
 I understand the IT business needs for both sizes of companies. I have worked with Executive level customers as<br>
 well as the consumer level customers. I have the ability to take technical explanations and make them <br> 
 understandable to any customer. I am always looking for ways to save money or to find a better way to perform a  <br>
 function that allows for a win-win outcome.<br><br>
 
Helping the less tech-minded community since 1989.
